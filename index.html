		<h3 class="headers">Projects I've Worked On</h3>
		<p>Here is a list of projects I've worked on.</p>
		<div class="project">
			<h3 class="headers">Hydromatic</h3>
			<p>This was my capstone project in university. The team and I built an automated hydroponics system using a mix a sensors, an Arduino UNO, and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
			<p>The langauges we used were C++ and Python. The C++ for the Arduino, which controlled all the sensors, lights, pumps and solinods in the growing enviroment, and Python for "brain" of the program. I was more involved with the Python/Raspberry Pi side of things. For that we used a blackboard architecture with the ideal growing conditions for basil. From the readings from the sensors we were able to determine if the growing conditions were adequate, and what changes needed to be made (add things to the growing solution, run a fan to let the air out, turn off the lights). We also had a rudimentary plant health monitor that took photos from a web cam and processed them to see if the basil was turning yellow.</p>
			<p>Users could interact with the device through a touchscreen mounted to the pi, which allowed them to set up the growing enviroment (at the time it was just for basil).</p>
			<p>We had a budget of $750 for the project, so we learned the importance of balancing costs. We were lucky that most components were cheap. The most expensive was the barrel we used to house everything, and the pH sensor.</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h3 class="headers">Sim racing indicator</h3>
			<p>This was a recent project that I was unable to finish. The inspiration came from the amount of free time I had at the start of the lock down for COVID-19 in Canada. We were told not to go into work, and I had, at the time, no remote access. I got into sim racing, playing a lot of Gran Turismo Sport and Project CARS 2. I was using the cockpit view and I was noticing that with some cars it was difficult to tell what gear you were in, and the engine was so quite you didn't know, until it was to late to shift gears. This was causing a lot of lost time, so I figred I needed an external indicator. Something that had LEDS to tell me my RPMS and if I had the pit limiter engaged, a display to tell me what gear I was in. Looking online to buy one was not an option because these things are EXPENSIVE!! I figured I'd take a crack at making one. I got a prototype going, but alas work got my remote access, and I have had no time to play or to improve the prototype or to find a way to hook it up to my wheel.</p>
			<p>The project used an Arduino UNO, because I really wasn't doing any calculations just simple things with buttons, and I had one lying around the house not doing anything. I had 8 LEDs as RPM indicator. 2 Blue for lower end, 4 Green for mid range, and 2 red for redline. My gear indicator was a seven segment display driven by a shift register. You find the project <a href="https://github.com/calcem/SimRacingLights">here</a>. There are pictures of the set up I was using to prototype. I hope that I can pick this one up again and work on it. </p>

		<div class="project">
			<h3 class="headers">Rehistoric</h3>
			<p>This was a hackaton project from 2015. The project was meant to be a native version control for the Mint operating system. The big thing for me was that this was the first time I had created a native appliacation, and it was the first time I had ever coded in C++. I had no idea how to do any of this when I decieded to join the team working on it, and by the end of the 2 day hackaton I had a good understanding of both.</p>
